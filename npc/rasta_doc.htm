<strong>Trial Rasta</strong><br>
Free trial rasta. You can use it as many times as you want, but you need to make a contract for each quest.<br>
Note that guild contribution points are not accumulated by having them accompany you on quests.<em>It's just a sample.</em></p>
<p>
<strong>Temporary Rastas</strong><br>
From the status screen of other hunters, you can make a temporary contract by selecting "Show sub menu" > "Confirm rasta" > "Temporary rasta".<br>
The contract will continue until you log out.</p>
<p>
<strong>Legendary Rastas</strong><br>
A contract can be signed by purchasing assist course. Contracts are made by talking to each legendary rasta at the "Rasta Tavern."<br>
Legendary rastas can be replaced at any time.</p>
Legendary rasta can participate in all quests except hunter dojo (excluding solo quests, of course).</p>
As a bonus, great luck is always in effect.<br>
A Legendary Poogie accompanies you and brings you items during quests (better than regular Poogie)<br>
In addition, one reward screen has been added after the quest ends, and you can randomly obtain materials for gathering, mining, and fishing.<br>
On that screen, when you hunt a large monster, you can get 3 additional frames of carving materials.<br>
(In the case of HC quests, HC materials are also included.)</p>
<strong>Contract Rasta</strong><br>
There are two types of contracts: “accompany contract” and “relief contract”.</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr><td rowspan=2>Hunter B</td><td>←(I want you to come on a quest)←</td><td rowspan=2>Hunter A</td><td></td><td>Accompanying contract (one person only)</td></tr>
<tr><td>→(I'm going on a quest.)→</td><td></td><td>Relief contract (can contract with up to 3 people)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The "accompaniment contract" made by Hunter A becomes a "relief contract" from the perspective of Hunter B.<br>
The contract should have both characters facing each other. (Additional account characters as the main, is not allowed.)<br>
・Contract Procedure<br>
　1.The person making the "relief contract" sits in the "relief contract" chair.(a chair with a backrest).<br>
　2.The person making the "accompanying contract" sits in the "accompanying contract seat." (round chair)<br>
　3.If both parties select "Yes" on the contract screen, the contract will be completed.<br>
　4.The party who took the "Accompanying Contract" needs to set "Rasta Accompaniment" in the "Rasta Reception" section.<br>
<em>※If you do not set "rasta accompany", Rasta will not come during the quest and you will not accumulate guild contribution points, so be careful not to forget to set it※</em><br>
<br>
This would be the maximum contracts<small>Viewed from Hunter A</small></p>

<strong>Rasta Accompaniment</strong><br>
If the "Rasta Accompaniment" option is set in "Rasta Reception", a rasta will accompany you during the quest.<br>
※If you do not set "rasta accompany", Rasta will not come during the quest and you will not accumulate guild contribution points, so be careful not to forget to set it※<br>
Acoompany Priority<br>
1：Legendary Rasta<br>
2：Temporary Rasta<br>
3：Rasta (including Instructor Rasta and Secret Instructor)<br>
4：Fosta<br>
<br>
◎Notes<br>
・If the maximum number of participants in the quest is reached, Rastas will not join you.<br>
　If quest is set to four and three hunters join, one of someone's rastas will be chosen at random.<br>
　If quest is set to two and two hunters join, Rastas will not join.<br>
　Rasta will not appear with Single-person, item restrictions, weapon and armor restrictions, combat maneuvers, solo only, etc.<br>
・Compensation for quests is also shared with rasta<br>
　Example: If you clear Counterattack Solo (with 2 or more participants) with a Rasta, the reward will be halved. (The rasta portion will be lost.)<br>
　※The reward money that disappeared does not go to Rasta, it just disappears.<br>
・If you don't want to lose rewards, just reduce the number of quest participants. (No issues with GRP, amount does not change)</p>
<p>
<strong>Guild Contribution Points</strong><br>
・1 point will be added to you and your Rasta companion hunter for every minute you participate in a quest.<br>
・If you set "rasta to accompany", you can get points even if the rasta does not actually participate in the quest.<br>
・Points will not be awarded if:<br>
　"Rasta accompany" is not set<br>
　Retire or fail the quest</p>
<p>
<strong>Obtaining materials from a rasta</strong><br>
・When your rasta accompanies another hunter on a quest, he/she brings back materials from the monster he/she hunted.<br>
・Materials brought back by the Rasta can be obtained from Rasta's receptionist at the Rasta Tavern, "Receive materials".<br>
・You can receive it twice a day (once from 0:00 to 11:59, once from 12:00 to 23:59). Stores up to 5</p>
<p>
<strong>Cancelling</strong><br>
Cancellation is done by talking to the "Rasta Reception".<br>
※Cancellation becomes possible after one week from the signing of the contract.</p>
<p>
<strong>Forced Cancellation</strong><br>
When 5 maintenances have passed since the last quest accompaniment<br>
※Note that if you go on a quest with the hunter you contracted from, you are not considered to have "accompanied" his rasta.<br>
　But since you can go on a quest where the other hunter is not there, forced cancellation does not happen often.</p>
