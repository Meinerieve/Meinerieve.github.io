・Action priority <em> (just a guess)</em><br>
　１．Received a status ailment attack: Use an item or remove it at quickly<br>
<small>　　※Snowball and crystals are removed quickly. Poison and stench use items.</small><br>
<small>　　※Only while under stench, the rastas may use deodorant balls on hunters (low priority).</small><br>
<small>　　※May cancel hunter's earplugs and stunned status</small><br>
　２．Boss monster in the area: Attack the boss monster<br>
<small>　　※Throw paintball first (will not throw if rasta has psychic skills)</small><br>
<small>　　※They cannot defeat boss monsters （will be stuck at about 10 HP)</small><br>
<small>　　※Prioritize attacking medium-sized monsters.</small><br>
<small>　　※don't attack monsters while they are sleeping</small><br>
　３．Boss monster attacks: Guard if it is possible to guard (performance is lower than auto guard)<br>
　４．Miscellaneous small monsters nearby: Attack the miscellaneous small monsters.<br>
　５．There is a monster corpse nearby: Carve it<br>
　６．Damage was taken. Attacked. Stamina decreased: use potions, whetstone, and cooked meat.<br>
　７．Hunter moves: Moves by automatically tracking the hunter<br>
<small>　　※When the hunter moves to another area, they use a nearcaster and move together. (Area movement is top priority)</small><br>
<small>　　※Drink a hot drink / cool drink when moving to the area (if it is required)</small><br>
<small>　　※if the hunter moves to a place where it can't be followed, it will warp to the hunter's location with a nearcaster.</small><br>
