<h4>Halk</h4>

<p>They will go on quests with you and help you defeat monsters.[HR1～]
<br>Unlike Rasta, it is not included in the number of participants, and 4 halks will participate in a 4-person PT.
<br>By raising them, you can increase their strength, attack power, etc., and also enable them to attack with elements.
<br>When completing hunting quests, halk feathers, halk calls, and books of learning may be dropped.
<br>
<br><strong>My Halk</strong>
<br>You can call the halk when you approach the rock in My Support.
<br>When the Halk is on the rock, you can feed it.
<br>By talking to the instructor, you can set up the book of learning skills and change the name.
</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>
<br>The initial value is randomly distributed so that the total of health, attack power, defense, and intellect is 10.
<br>"Intimacy"、"Health"、"Attack"、"Defense"、"Intellect" Halk will level up when all five values reach the right end of the gauge.
<br>LV1:Max 255　LV2:Max 510　LV3:Max 765
<br>As they level up, not only do their abilities change but also the halk's appearance changes.
