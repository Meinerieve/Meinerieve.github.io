<h4>My Garden</h4>

<p>By talking to the straw cat, you can request "watering," "cleaning," "cooking," "mining," "catching," "pickling" and "rubbish".
<br>On rare occasions you can select "bargains".
<br>You may only request an item one time per quest. After the next successful or failed hunt you can select again.
<br>The "cooking" and "rubbish" options require you to have the requisite items in your inventory
<br>Items in "rubbish" vary according to the number of quests completed. Clearing via sub-quest counts towards this amount.
<br>You will sometimes receive various items talking to the garden cats.
<br>A lost and found cat can sometimes appear and ask you to find a specific item to bring to it.
</p>
<p><strong>Garden Rank</strong>
<br>You will receive a stamp when you purchase furniture with materials from the general store "Farm and Furniture" section.
<br>One stamp will be added for each furniture purchase that uses at least one material and costs 3000z in a single purchase.
<br>(With EX course enabled it will be 1 stamp for every 2000z used.)
<br>By collecting these stamps, you can rank up the "Lucky tools" and "Super tools" that you use in My Garden.
</p>
<p><strong>Stamp Benefits</strong>
<br>Stamps can be exchanged in the "Farm & Furniture" section of the General Store for the items listed below.
